-------------------------

 Geneml is a genetic algorithms library written in the Objective Caml
language. Its object-oriented design allows for flexible creation of
genetic algorithm components, including selection system and simulation
frameworks. 

 Instructions

successfully on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows 2000.

 To compile simply type 'make'. To compile native code type 'make all.opt'.

 Run ./genesys -help to see the possibly commands. Likewise use 
./knapsack -help. itemgen.pl is included to generate random sets of items
data for feeding into the knapsack program.
